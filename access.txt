“I have familiarized myself with the basic functionality of Git. I am able to add, modify,
revert and remove files in the repository and I will continue learning about other
features of Git. I will use the repository in a timely manner for all work completed as
a part of the group project. That is, I will maintain a current copy of the repository by
pulling it frequently as well as pushing any changes as soon as they are ready to be
shared. I understand that the instructor has access to the complete history (log) of the
repository and my individual contributions will be judged based on that log.
I have verified that I have access to the Discussion Forum on Moodle. I have shared
my availability with other group members. All group members decided on at least one
time slot that works for everyone.”
