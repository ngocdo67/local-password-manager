Project Summary:
The password manager encrypts and stores all your passwords in a single place securely. The system expects the user to remember only one master password that gives the user access to an encrypted file containing all their password data. The system can be used to generate a new password, retrieve, modify, and delete an existing password. 

Problem statement:
Almost every website a user visits requires them to sign in/sign up. A highly recommended  practice for users is to have a unique password for every account they have. A downside of this practice is that users will have too many long passwords to remember considering the huge amount of online and offline accounts they could have. Moreover, every website has different requirements for creating new password which further complicates things for a user. To avoid all complications, users often use a single password for multiple websites to avoid inconvenience of forgetting password. This is a security risk as any hacked username/password makes all other passwords vulnerable.
Password manager provides a better solution to this problem. Users only need to memorize one password, the rest are randomly generated and stored locally for the user. The manager can also generate passwords according to website specifications. This allows the user to easily access, store, modify, delete or generate a safe and unique password for any website.
